            <br> <br> <br>
            I was interested in IT since my childhood.
            At the moment I found the "Developer-Akademie.de" my new Chapter of life was sealed. Now I'm in
            Education with "Developer-Akademie.de" and looking for a Job as Junior Front-End Web Developer.

            In May 2014, I successfully completed my apprenticeship as a warehouse logistics specialist. Then I
            worked in this industry to this day, in a few small and large companies, and collected professional
            skills.
